# homework_3_sb — Final Grade Calculator (Flutter)


Here I created the app with editable fields:
  - Participation & Attendance (10%)
  - 4 Homeworks (20% total, average)
  - Group Presentation (10%)
  - Midterm 1 (10%)
  - Midterm 2 (20%)
  - Final Project (30%)

The user has options to:
- edit the scores
- add/remove homework items (max 4) + reset
- maintain values (via shared_preferences)

## Run
flutter pub get
flutter run
